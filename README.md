# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution





### Overview

I got a lot of insight and confidence in myself while building this project. I learn  how to consume end point making use. I learn more about Ajax and fetch Api. 




### Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location



## My process
-I designed and built the UI using Semantic HTML5 and CSS. And ensured that the page is mobile responsive.

- I make lot of research on Ajax
- I make research how to consume an end point

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
